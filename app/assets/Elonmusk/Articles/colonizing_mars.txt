Elon Musk and SpaceX have proposed the development of Mars transportation infrastructure in order to facilitate the eventual colonization of Mars. The mission architecture includes fully reusable launch vehicles, human-rated spacecraft, on-orbit propellant tankers, rapid-turnaround launch/landing mounts, and local production of rocket fuel on Mars via in situ resource utilization (ISRU). SpaceX's aspirational goal is to land the first humans on Mars by 2024.

The key element of the infrastructure is the SpaceX Starship, a fully reusable second stage and space vehicle. To achieve a large payload, the spacecraft first enters Earth orbit, where it is refueled before it departs to Mars. After landing on Mars, the spacecraft is loaded with locally-produced propellants to return to Earth. The expected payload of Super Heavy is for the Starship second stage to inject between 100–150 tonnes (220,000–330,000 lb) to Mars.

SpaceX intends to concentrate its resources on the transportation part of the Mars colonization project, including the design of a propellant plant based on the Sabatier process that will be deployed on Mars to synthesize methane and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants from the local supply of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-accessible water ice. However, Musk advocates a larger set of long-term Mars settlement objectives, going far beyond what SpaceX projects to build; a successful colonization would ultimately involve many more economic actors—whether individuals, companies, or governments—to facilitate the growth of the human presence on Mars over many decades.
