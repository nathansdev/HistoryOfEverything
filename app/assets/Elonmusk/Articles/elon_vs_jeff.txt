The 21st-century space race is here. And in the midst of it all is a battle of the billionaires. On one side you have Elon Musk, CEO and founder of SpaceX. On the other, Jeff Bezos, CEO and founder of Blue Origin. Both are in a race to make space travel more affordable. And as each company continues to grow and expand, that race is heating up.

Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are in an epic feud that's been raging for years. But it wasn't always the case. In 2004, for example, the two titans had dinner together. Today, instead of passing ideas, they're berating each other for the world to see. Here's how things got so out of hand.

One of the biggest flair ups started in 2013, over the historic launch complex 39A. After the Space Shuttles retired in 2011, NASA wasn't using the launch pad. Bezos went so far as to file a complaint with the government to prevent SpaceX from getting the launch pad.

The feud was officially in full swing. Ultimately, SpaceX won. Signing a 20-year lease for the pad 39A in 2014. Then, later that same year, the two billionaires were at it again. This time, over patents. Bezos had filed a patent for the technology to build reusable rockets. A tactic which could have earned him millions of dollars from competitors who aimed to use similar technology. But when Musk found out about it, he stepped in.

By the end of 2015, the feud had made it to the world stage: Twitter. In November, Blue Origin launched and landed its suborbital rocket for the first time.

By 2019, the number of confrontations had reached a record high. At a private lecture in NYC, Bezos criticized Musk's goal to colonize Mars.

But in the end, it doesn't really matter which of them is first to the moon or first to set up a colony beyond Earth.
