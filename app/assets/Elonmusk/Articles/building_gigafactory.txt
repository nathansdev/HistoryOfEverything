Tesla Gigafactory.

Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles and energy products. Tesla broke ground on the Gigafactory in June 2014 outside Sparks, Nevada. The name Gigafactory comes from the word 'Giga,' the unit of measurement representing “billions.”

The Gigafactory is being built in phases so that Tesla can begin manufacturing immediately inside the finished sections and continue to expand thereafter.
Once complete, Tesla expects the Gigafactory to be the biggest building in the world – and entirely powered by renewable energy sources.
