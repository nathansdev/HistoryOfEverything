In 2001, a 30-year-old Musk had already made his fortune twice over, founding and selling companies such as Zip2 and X.Com (which became PayPal) for hundreds of millions. He felt called to something more meaningful than just running another Internet business and decided he would put his money toward saving humanity, and specifically, through life on Mars.

Knowing Russian launch vehicles are the cheapest rockets available would help his fortune stretch further. To this end, the space advocacy nonprofit Mars Society put him in touch with Jim Cantrell, an aerospace consultant who had worked for NASA’s jet propulsion lab and on a joint Mars balloon mission for the French Space Agency and the Soviet Union.

The cold call he made with Cantrell helped kick off a multi-year cramming session where Musk reportedly taught himself what he needed to know about rockets.

Musk borrowed Cantrell’s college textbooks on rocketry and propulsion and got reading, eventually being able to recite from memory books like “Fundamentals of Astrodynamics,” and the “International Reference Guide to Space Launch Systems.”

Musk gave his cold-call pitch to a Russian rocket designer when he was looking to buy repurposed rockets he had heard the Russians were selling. Cantrell traveled to Russia with Musk for this meeting and says the designer became visibly upset, explaining that the technology was intended as a weapon for war, not for capitalist billionaires to purchase. The designer reportedly even spat on their shoes, Cantrell recalled for Wired.

After the disappointment from meeting with russian rocket designer musk met cantrell from John Garvey a space tech veteran then started learning more about rockets and went on to build own rockets.
