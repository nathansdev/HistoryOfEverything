For the first time since SpaceX began recovering its Falcon 9 fleet, the company failed to land one of its rockets that was meant to touch down on solid ground. Just seven minutes after launching from Florida this afternoon, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was preparing to land on the company’s concrete landing pad back near the launch site at Cape Canaveral. But footage from the booster showed it spinning out of control, and SpaceX commentators confirmed that the vehicle hit the Atlantic Ocean instead.
